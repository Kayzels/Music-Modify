Music Modify
============

Welcome to Music Modify - an app designed in order to allow you to have greater control over the tags in your music files.

Setup
-----

This is written in Python, and assumes you have a Python installation.

You can edit which tags should be displayed, and edited in the config.ini file. Instructions are written in that file.

Using the App
-------------

You can drag files into the app, or add files and folders using the buttons.

After selecting the files that should be edited, you can select "Create New Job" to perform actions on the selected files.

You can view the progress of the actions selected.

Warning
-------

Adding many files at the same time is possible, but will take a while. It takes approximately half an hour to process 10 000 files.
